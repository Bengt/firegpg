FireGPG is no longer supported.  It's original author abandoned the project.

We simply grabbed a copy of the code and made it available on GitHub.

This extension is compatible with Firefox 3 and above, on Windows, MacOS and Linux platforms.

If members of the community want to submit patches, they will be accepted, but we will not
be performing much (if any) testing on them.

Several people from the FireGPG community have banded together and are working on two
new projects.  One is a replacement for FireGPG that will apparently initially target
the Chrome web browser from Google and then be released for Firefox.
The second is gpgAuth which is available for Chrome. (https://github.com/gpgauth)
